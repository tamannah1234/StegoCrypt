# StegoCrypt
StegoCrypt is a steganography-based encryption project that hides secret messages within images, ensuring secure communication. It allows users to encode and decode messages using password protection, making data transmission more private and secure.

Features
✅ Hide secret messages inside images
✅ Secure decryption with a passcode
✅ Simple and lightweight implementation using OpenCV

Technologies Used
* Python
* OpenCV
* NumPy
How to Use
* Encryption (Hiding the Message)
* Run the script and provide an image filename.
* Enter the secret message and a passcode.
* The tool will generate an encrypted image containing the hidden message.
* Decryption (Extracting the Message)
* Run the script and provide the encrypted image.
* Enter the correct passcode to retrieve the hidden message.
Installation
* pip install opencv-python numpy
* python stegocrypt.py
